Does the wind know when to stop or do you have to act like the wall? 

Does it apologize as it bumps into you or does the impropriety always prevail? 

Does it always deign to cool you down or does it bring the heat you fear? 

When it stops do you feel the dearth of it or do you not really care?

Does it move you where you want to go or is it another hindrance to bear? 

Does it leave everything it started out with or is that dust not really there?

Do you fear that it'll blow away all that you hold dear? 

Or do you actually wish for that end to be very near?
